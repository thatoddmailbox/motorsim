# motorsim
This is a program that simulates a (very basic, two pole) DC motor. It was my final project for the Spring 2020 offering of my physics class, ES.802.

You can try it out by going to https://alex.studer.dev/motorsim/.

If you want to know more about how it works and its limitations, see [the slides](./slides.pdf).
